Certainly! Below is a template for a `README.md` file for your npm package that combines five npm packages to create a DApp for token swapping on an EVM-based blockchain:

```markdown
# TokenSwap DApp

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for swapping tokens on EVM-compatible blockchains. It integrates five npm packages to provide a seamless token swapping experience.

## Features

- **Token Swapping**: Swap between different ERC-20 tokens.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Works with any EVM-based blockchain.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Automated Testing**: Includes end-to-end tests with Puppeteer.

## Installation

To get started with the TokenSwap DApp, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grxkun/swapmytea.git
cd token-swap-dapp
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the DApp locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the DApp in your default web browser.

## Smart Contracts

The `contracts` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts used for token swapping. You can deploy these contracts to any EVM-compatible blockchain.

## Testing

Run the automated tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
